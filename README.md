# Negative Space Chatroom

This project is a Flask-based web application that simulates a chatroom inspired by the novel *Negative Space* by B. R. Yeager. The chatroom features bots that respond in a dark and melancholic tone using GPT-2.

## Features

- **Dark and Melancholic Responses**: Bots respond with a consistently pessimistic and gloomy tone.
- **Random Bot Selection**: A bot is randomly selected to respond if none is specifically mentioned.
- **Memory**: Each bot retains conversation history for more context-aware responses.

## Requirements

- Python
- Flask
- Transformers library (Hugging Face)
